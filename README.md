# Set-Programming-Language
A programming language using set to store values

A set is a typical array with no duplicated data and all values within a set is different. Thus, we cannot visit specific numbers in a set. Set have its set operations. The programming language also have array types.

The biggest difference between this programming language and other languages is that the for-loops and functions only contain one line. Functions are all lambda and contain one line of code. For-loops is actually a function instead of a statement.

The Python version is obsolete and is not supported.

The project is rewritten in Go.

There might be quite a few bugs. Feel free to issue them.
