# Set-Programming-Language
A programming language using set to store values

A set is a typical array with no duplicated data and all values within a set is different. Thus, we cannot visit specific numbers in a set. Set have its set operations. However, they are not completed yet. The programming language also have array types. This type is also not completed.

The biggest difference between this programming language and other languages is that the for loop and functions only contain one line. Functions are all lambda and contain one line of code. For loops becomes a function instead of a statement. This programming languages inherits the spirit of functional programming.

Althought it is not completed. The spirit part can be shown.



1.

You can use **python interactive.py** to have an interactive console and use **python main.py** to see the result of sample 'debug.sp'

This programming language requires **python3** to run.

2.

There is also a Golang version of it. The golang version does not have interactive console, thought it is easy to programme. It runs debug.sp and interprets it.



There might be quite a few bugs. Feel free to issue them.
